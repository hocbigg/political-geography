# Summary

The Political Geography curriculum is a **complete education in Political Geography** using online materials.

Political Geography examines the spatial aspects of political processes, including territories, borders, geopolitics, electoral systems, and resource distribution.

## Organization

- **Intro Political Geography**: Orientation to core disciplines.
- **Core Political Geography**: Builds depth in key political geography topics, equivalent to the first three years of a traditional program.
- **Advanced Political Geography**: In the Advanced Phase, choose one track for deeper focus. Each track includes 3 subjects, allowing specialization while maintaining breadth.
    - **Geopolitics and International Security**: Focuses on global power dynamics, conflicts, and strategic territories.
    - **Electoral and Political Boundaries**: Emphasizes domestic politics, voting patterns, and identity-based divisions.
    - **Environmental Political Geography**: Explores the intersection of politics, resources, and environmental challenges.


Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

## Capstone

Design and execute a research project applying political geography concepts (e.g., map and analyze a geopolitical conflict, electoral districting, or environmental resource dispute). Include a 20–30 page report with spatial analysis (e.g., using GIS tools from core studies), case studies, and policy recommendations. Aim for 100–200 hours total, demonstrating mastery through original insight.


## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Political Geography.
Congratulations!
