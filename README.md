# Summary

The Political Geography curriculum is a **complete education in Political Geography** using online materials.

Political Geography examines the spatial aspects of political processes, including territories, borders, geopolitics, electoral systems, and resource distribution.

## Organization

- **Intro Political Geography**: Orientation to core disciplines.
- **Core Political Geography**: Builds depth in key political geography topics, equivalent to the first three years of a traditional program.
- **Advanced Political Geography**: In the Advanced Phase, choose one track for deeper focus. Each track includes 3 subjects, allowing specialization while maintaining breadth.
    - **Geopolitics and International Security**: Focuses on global power dynamics, conflicts, and strategic territories.
    - **Electoral and Political Boundaries**: Emphasizes domestic politics, voting patterns, and identity-based divisions.
    - **Environmental Political Geography**: Explores the intersection of politics, resources, and environmental challenges.


Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Study these first, in this order:

**I. Foundations: Spatial Thinking and Political Basics**: Start here. This part teaches you how to think spatially and introduces the most important political ideas you will use throughout the entire curriculum.

**II. Maps, Space, and Territorial Representation**: Next, learn how maps work, how space is represented, and the basics of geographic information systems. These skills are used in almost every later topic.

**III. Core Political Geography**: This is the heart of the discipline. Study the main concepts, theories, and ways political geographers think about states, territory, and power.

**V. Geopolitics and Global Power**: Finish the core by understanding how political geography explains power relations, conflict, and strategy at the international scale.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are optional deeper explorations. You do **not** need to study all of them. Pick 1–3 tracks that interest you most or match your goals:

- **IV. Borders, Nations, and Identity**: Focuses on how boundaries are created, maintained, and experienced, and how national identities form.
- **VI. Political Economy and Resources**: Explores the geography of economic systems, natural resources, and environmental conflicts.
- **VII. Electoral and Population Geography**: Examines how space shapes elections, voting behavior, population movements, and demographic power.
- **VIII. Environmental and Climate Political Geography**: Looks at the political dimensions of environmental issues and global climate change.
